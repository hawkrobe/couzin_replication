Before running the experiment, the "light fields" that determine the 
participants' scores must be created.

running 
python ./light-fields/main.py [out_dir]

will create 4 time fields of 2880 time steps for three differen noise
leves in the out_dir folder

these files are stored in the directory
[out_dir]/[name]-[noise (formatted)]/

where the noise variable formatting expresses the noise variable in
scientific notation, with the period removed and any negative sign
replaced with an "n".

and the files for each time in each field have file names of the form
[out_dir]/[name]-[noise (formatted)]/t[time].csv

The [name] variable is simply an ID for the experiment.  The [noise]
variable gives the noise level of the experiment.

--- example ---

python main.py ~/

will create the files
t0.csv
t1.csv
...
t2879.csv

in 
~/0-1en01/
~/1-1en01/
...
~/3-5en01/
