strategy,I was to seek and find by myself initially. If I could not find the goal myself, I saw if the other players slowed down and that would indicate that they were probably closed to the goal area. At that point I would follow them.
changes,My strategy did not change. I found and stayed with my final strategy from the start of the game to finish.

relative,same
bugs,no problems experienced
instructions,the instructions were clear
