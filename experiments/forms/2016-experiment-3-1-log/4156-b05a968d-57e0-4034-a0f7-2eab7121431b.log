strategy,I moved around as fast as I could to different areas until I started glowing and then I stopped until the glow went away.  Then I started moving around again. I also tried to pay attention to when the other person stopped moving and go to that location as that was likely where the scoring section was located.
changes,Not really.  I used the same strategy. The only difference was when the other person stopped but was too far away, sometimes I didn&#039;t try to make it there because it took too long.
others,Yes, I think so.
relative,same
bugs,No, nothing.
instructions,Nothing at all.
fair,Yes, I think it was fair.
comments,None, thanks.
