strategy,I sped around the map looking for the bonus area, as did the other players it seemed. I would slow if I came into it and wiggle around by clicking rapidly while trying to follow it.
changes,Not really, I kept the same strategy throughout. However, I paid more attention to other people closer to the end because they started stopping if they were on it.
others,Kind of, they stopped instead of rapidly clicking to wiggle the avatar.
relative,same
bugs,Not really, no.
instructions,Nope.
fair,I think it&#039;s alright.
comments,Fun game! If you decide to improve upon it I&#039;d be interested in playing it later.
