strategy,I tried to stay in the bonus area as long as possible and move &quot;towards&quot; it
changes,I changed my strategy when I noticed stopping in the bonus area didn&#039;t always work and tried to chase it essentially
others,I think other people would use the same strategy
relative,better
bugs,no issues
instructions,no
fair,I feel the pay was mostly fair, maybe it could be just a tad bit higher
comments,This was a fun game and I hope you do more HITS in the future
