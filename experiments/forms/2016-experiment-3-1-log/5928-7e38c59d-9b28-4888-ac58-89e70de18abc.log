strategy,I tried to watch for when others were stopped or moving slowly. The only time everyone seemed to move fast was when they were looking for the bonus area.
changes,If no one was moving slowly or stopped then I would start doing a random pattern around where most of the people were.
others,Probably developed something similar over time.
relative,same
bugs,No
instructions,No
fair,Yes
comments,This was really fun to play and I would like to play again!
