strategy,I would hold &quot;a&quot; and search around the entire map until the border changed to gold, at which point I would slow down and try to follow the region as it moved.
changes,My strategy remained the same the whole time
others,I think most other players would use a similar strategy
relative,same
bugs,I encountered one instance of lag where my game froze for a few seconds
instructions,No
fair,Yes
