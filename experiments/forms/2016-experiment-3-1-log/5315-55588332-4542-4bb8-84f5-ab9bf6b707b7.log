strategy,My initial strategy was to follow the group because more than likely they were close.
changes,Yes it did change over time. I started moving a little bit away from the group and then once I found the magic dust and was in the circle I Put on the brakes and floated to gain more points. It seemed to work because they were quantifying rather quickly. It was a lot better than scrambling around and hitting circle only for a few seconds.
others,Yes, I think they were pretty much following the group like I was.
relative,same
bugs,I noticed no problems.
instructions,No, they were very comprehensible.
fair,Absolutely!
comments,I really needed a hit like this today to enlighten my mood. Thank you so much for having me and I wish you the best with your study.
