strategy,I tried to stay spread out from the other player to cover the most area between us, but not too far away so I could try to make it to his spot in time when I noticed he was sitting still.
changes,When I figured out how fast the spot changes I stayed much closer to the other player.  I also noticed the spot seemed to be following a pattern around the area.  The next spot was always somewhat nearby, so I stopped wandering and just followed the other person.
others,Probably.  It didn&#039;t take too long to realize what to do.
