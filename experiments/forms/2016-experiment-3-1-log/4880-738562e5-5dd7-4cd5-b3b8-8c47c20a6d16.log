strategy,I tried to move through all of the parts of the game field quickly and strategically and then hit stop as soon as the magic was activated.
changes,I kept the same stragegy, but after I had completed all parts by going vertically, I switched to horizontally.
others,I would think it would be a common approach.
relative,same
bugs,No problems.
instructions,They seemed pretty clear to me.
fair,Yes, thank you very much.
comments,Fun.
