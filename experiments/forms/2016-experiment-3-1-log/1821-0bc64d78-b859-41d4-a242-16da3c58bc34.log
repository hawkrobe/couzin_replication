strategy,I kept accelerating around the screen until I found a sparkling spot, and then stopped there to get as many points as possible
changes,Yes, at first I paid no attention to the other players, but if I noticed them congregating in a certain area, I would go to the same place
others,No, I didn&#039;t see that many people used acceleration as much as me
relative,better
bugs,No
instructions,No
fair,Definitely
comments,Interesting game
