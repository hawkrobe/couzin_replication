strategy,I tried to move quickly to maximize my time - and once I found the spot, I then tried to slow down in order to maximize my time in the spot.
changes,I don&#039;t think that my strategy changed over time.   I knew that I only had 5 minutes and I needed to maximize every second to earn as many points as possible.
others,I think that other people probably used the same strategy as well.   
relative,same
