strategy,I went from corner to corner to try and create a search grid.
changes,Once I initially found the correct spot, I was able to tail it fairly well by making small changes in my search pattern. It took more than half the game to get to my final strategy.
others,I think people use similar strategies.
relative,same
bugs,no problems
instructions,no
fair,yes
comments,This was fun.
