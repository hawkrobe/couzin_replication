strategy,Tried to predict the path of the bonus area, but that didn&#039;t seem to ever work, so I would constantly try to correct course when it disappeared, and run around until I found it again. There seemed to only be one other player attempting to speed up when he lost the zone, so if I saw him slow down or stop I would go over to him, knowing he had found the bonus area.

others,Maybe
relative,better
bugs,No
instructions,No
