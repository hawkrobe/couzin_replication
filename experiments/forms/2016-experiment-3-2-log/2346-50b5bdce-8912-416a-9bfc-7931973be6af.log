strategy,I moved as quickly as could to cover areas and immediately hit S to stop when I began to sparkle.  I also looked out for other stopped players and then navigated to their location, as I figured they had found a magical spot.
changes,I maintained the same strategy, I just became more coordinated in covering as much ground as possible looking for magical spots, stopping quickly when I found them, and staying aware of other players stopping.
others,I think at least one other player did.  We seemed to cluster often and/or navigate to each others locations when noticing stops.
relative,same
