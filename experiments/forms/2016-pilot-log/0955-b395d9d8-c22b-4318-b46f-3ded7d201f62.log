strategy,I tried to see where the other players were going and see if they were stopping so I could head there
changes,Yes. At first I tried to just scan the field and see if I could follow the sparkle, but that didn&#039;t work
others,Yes, I think they did
relative,worse
bugs,No problems
instructions,No, but in the example it showed the bonus area moving like in a progression but it never could be followed that way. It seemed more like it jumped places.
fair,it was fine
comments,Just what I said about the unclear instructions, I wasn&#039;t sure the magic area was moving smoothly along because I was never able to follow it.
