strategy,I tried to cover all areas and go zigzag as much as I can. I keep the speed up the entire time to cover more ground.
changes,Not really. At first, I went in circles, but I realized I&#039;m not covering all the ground. By a minute in, I went zigzag with the strategy.
others,I don&#039;t think there were other people. I would think most people would just go randomly.
relative,same
bugs,No, there were no glitches.
instructions,No, everything was good!
fair,Yes, the pay with the bonus is definitely fair.
comments,No, it was interesting and fun since I knew if I played better I would get more bonus. Thanks!
