I tried to find where the bonus area was and stay there as long as possible
no my strategy didnt change
probably
about the same, maybe worse
no
no
No, It was pretty low considering I had read all the instrctions, answer questions,  waited a few minutes, then got kicked out due to &quot;inactivity&quot; even though I was just waiting for the game to start as instructed, so i had to re do the instructions, answer the questions again, wait again, and then do the game, which did not yield a very high bonus
thanks....
