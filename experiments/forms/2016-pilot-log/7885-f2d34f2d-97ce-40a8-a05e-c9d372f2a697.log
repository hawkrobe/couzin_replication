strategy,For the most part I randomly moved around until I hit the magic region.
changes,It took about a minute for me to move around in a specific pattern to maximize my contact with the region.
others,I&#039;m not sure, but no one else was in the game with me.
relative,same
bugs,Very choppy movement and laggy feedback.
instructions,Movement for the character wasn&#039;t provided until just before the game started.
fair,I thought it was worse than it actually ended up being, which I was happy about.
