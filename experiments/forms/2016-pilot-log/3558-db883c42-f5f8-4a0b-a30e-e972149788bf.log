strategy,I hover around the map trying to figure the position of the magical area, however I always had an eye on the movements of the other player. 
changes,No, I sticked with my initial plan to the end of the game.
others,Yes
relative,better
bugs,No
instructions,No
fair,Yes
comments,Yes, I would like it even more if there were another participant. Playing just two people it makes the game a little dull, and quiet slow to find the magical area.
