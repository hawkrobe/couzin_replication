I tried to go around the entire square to cover as much ground as possible and also look at the other &quot;players&quot; arrow to see when they would slow down considerably.
No, it did not. 
I don&#039;t believe so.
I think I scored well enough or just as much as others.
I did not notice any problems.
Nothing seemed unclear.
Yes, I do.
Thank you so much and good luck with your research.
