strategy,I ran around randomly until I found a spot.  Also I&#039;d try to hit up where other people were stopped or slow in case they&#039;d found one.
changes,Not really.  It stayed the same.
others,Mostly yes, though I think only a couple were really chasing other players much.
relative,same
bugs,It would freeze every once and a while, but didn&#039;t really affect anything.
instructions,It was somehow a little unclear to me that I needed to use the mouse.
fair,Sort of.  It could have had a bit higher base pay, unless on average people get more bonus.
comments,no
