strategy,Search quickly and then stop moving when you find the zone. When the sound moves try to search for it nearby (though this never worked). If there were other players, I would have used them for hints.
changes,It didn&#039;t occur to me to stop moving while in the zone for the first few seconds.
others,I don&#039;t think there are many other strategies.
relative,worse
bugs,Occasionally movement was choppy. Which is sad because even though this is an old laptop it is an old gaming laptop.
instructions,Nothing unclear.
fair,It was more than I calculated so I it is better than the rate I thought it was.
comments,There were no other players. Don&#039;t know if this was intentional or not.
