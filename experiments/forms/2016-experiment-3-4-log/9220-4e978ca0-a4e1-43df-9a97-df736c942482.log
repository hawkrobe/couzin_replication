strategy,I tried to cover as much of the playing area as possible, in the shortest amount of time so used the A to accelerate and investigate the area. When I discovered the gold circle I&#039;d stop using A and just let my cursor follow along with it. Once I lost it I&#039;d try to find it again.
changes,No, it was pretty much the same the whole way through, once I understood how it worked.
others,probably
relative,same
bugs,no
instructions,no
fair,yes
comments,The game was strangely fun..thanks for the opportunity to participate and good luck with your research.
