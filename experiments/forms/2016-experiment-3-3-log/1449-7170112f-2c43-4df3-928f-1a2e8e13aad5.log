strategy,I tried to figure out the direction the magic zone was going and keep my speed the same as it was going to maximize the time I was in the zone.
changes,No, as I found the zone, this was the strategy that I kept.
others,Yes.
relative,same
bugs,It was choppy and jumpy sometimes, and I run on a decent rig, so I don&#039;t think it was on my end.
instructions,No it was all very clear.
fair,Very fair. Thank you.
comments,Great hit. Wish there were many more like it. Have a great day.
