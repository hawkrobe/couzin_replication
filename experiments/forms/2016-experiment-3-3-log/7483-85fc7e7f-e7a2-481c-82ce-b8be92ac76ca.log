strategy,Criss crossed the playing field and watched for other players to slow or stop.
changes,I was kind of doing that from the start but changed a little bit more on how I moved in relation to the stopped/slowed players positions.
others,Yes, I do.
relative,same
bugs,Sometimes I would have to push &quot;A&quot; multiple times to go faster.
instructions,One of the quiz questions was a little vague about the scoring.
fair,Yes
comments,I wish I could have played long. I think it would be fun if you could shoot the other players just like the old asteroid ship.
