strategy,I didn&#039;t actually get to play the game. I sat in the waiting room moving my avatar around for maybe 90 seconds before getting forwarded to this page. Apparently I was removed due to network latency issues.
changes,N/A
others,N/A
relative,worse
bugs,It seemed to operate fine for the brief time I was in the waiting room.
instructions,No problems.
fair,Yes.
comments,I didn&#039;t notice any lagging or anything that would&#039;ve indicated latency issues. On the other hand, I am on a satellite connection, so it&#039;s certainly possible.
