strategy,Wait, I was only in the waiting room the whole time.  But if I had played, my strategy would be to either locate the magic area by myself, or look where everyone else is congregated.
changes,Yes, depending on if I see a gathering of other players or not.
others,Probably
relative,worse
bugs,I was only in the waiting room, I never got into the main play before I had to answer this end survey.
instructions,No.
fair,Well considering I never got to the actual playing field, I guess.
comments,Fun survey for what I had to do.
