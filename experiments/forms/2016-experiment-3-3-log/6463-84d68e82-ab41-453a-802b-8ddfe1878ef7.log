strategy,I tried to imagine where the path of the zone would go but if I missed it I would have to make circles around it and then just randowmly try to find it back and try to tail it as much as I could once I found it.
changes,I used the same one I think.  It was disconcerting to fail to find the zone that was right there and then gone. There was not much I could do to find it back but to randomly try to find it again.
others,Maybe. It&#039;s not much a of a strategy really but I could see other people trying like me to hit as many corners to try to find it back.
relative,same
bugs,No. The other arrows were distracting and annoying but there was no glitch.
instructions,No there were unusually clear and concise for game instructions. Usually they are a mess and convoluted. This was a nice change.
fair,I like to take my time and this writing section is probably taking me more time then the average survey taker, But with the bonus it seems fair.
comments,The game was fun but the arrows didn&#039;t seem to be real people. They were clustered together and didn&#039;t seem like they had a mind of their own. Felt like  computer was guiding them.
