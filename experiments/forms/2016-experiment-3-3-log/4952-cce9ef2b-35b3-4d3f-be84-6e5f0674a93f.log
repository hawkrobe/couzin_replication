strategy,Keep accelerating, and cover all the territory possible.
changes,At first I needed to figure out to accelerate. Once I got stuck on the wall for awhile and couldn&#039;t seem to get off. I say I figured out the initial accelerating plan within 30 seconds.
others,Probably.
relative,same
bugs,Only about 30 seconds when I got stuck on the top wall, and couldn&#039;t seem to navigate off.
instructions,I thought they were a little tough to focus on, and had to reread, then had to refer back to answer the comprehension questions.
fair,Yes
