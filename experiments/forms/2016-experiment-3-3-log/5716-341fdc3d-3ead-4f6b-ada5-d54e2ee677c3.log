strategy,I tried to cover as much area as possible and keep in the sparkle path
changes,I did get the time to form a strategy as i was kicked off  the game for latency issues.
others,No strategy was used as the time in the game was mere seconds.
relative,worse
bugs,Movement was choppy i think thats why i was kicked off.
instructions,Instructions are perfect.
fair,yes.
comments,i need one more try please.
