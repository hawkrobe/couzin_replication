strategy,I tried criss-crossing the screen in a grid pattern. I also watched the other players. If one of the players seemed to hover in an area, I targeted that area also.
changes,I used a combination of both strategies.  If I did find the area, I tried to circle around in that area.
others,Yes.  When I found the area and hovered there, I noticed the other players quickly headed in that direction.
relative,same
bugs,No bugs or problems
instructions,No, everything was clear.
fair,Yes.
