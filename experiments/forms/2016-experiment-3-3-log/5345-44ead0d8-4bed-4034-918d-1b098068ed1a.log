strategy,move diagonally, accelerating all the time, keeping aware of what other players were doing. If they were moving, they were searching for the area as well, so I kept moving. If they stopped, I tried to get closer to them.
changes,Not really. I always tried to accelerate. My guess is that the areas were randomly generated, so I tried to find locations in random areas after an area was a bonus area.
others,Probably so
relative,better
bugs,No, game was good!
instructions,Not at all
fair,Yes
comments,No
