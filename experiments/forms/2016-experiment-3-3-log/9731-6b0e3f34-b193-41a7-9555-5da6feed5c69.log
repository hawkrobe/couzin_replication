strategy,What strategy? I was told that I was in the waiting room and to move away from the wall. I clicked a spot away from the wall, and then I was here. The &quot;game&quot; lasted about 5 seconds. Did you do something wrong?
changes,&quot;Changing over time&quot; would require time to pass.
others,Yes, I think everyone who was kicked out of the game after five seconds used the same non-strategy as me.
relative,same
bugs,Yes, it ended after five seconds!
instructions,No, the instructions were fine, the game was messed up.
fair,I don&#039;t even know how to answer that question.
comments,I am so sick of dealing with broken HITs right now, I could scream.
