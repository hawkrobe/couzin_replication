strategy,Move as quickly as possible and cover as much ground as I could. I kept an eye on the others and would move to a spot if i saw everyone in that same spot.
changes,Yes. At first I did my own thing, then I followed others. Then as I began finding the zones, I would branch off as it did not seem like the others were very in tune.
others,No.
relative,same
bugs,No.
instructions,No.
fair,Yes.
