strategy,If I didn&#039;t see someone slowing I changed the area of search.
changes,Not very much, I just tried to stay active and aware.
others,I think at least one was just constantly on the move, one seemed to be doing similar.
relative,better
bugs,It seemed a bit choppy at times.
instructions,No, seemed fairly obvious how to play and the bonus explanation.
fair,I think so, it was enjoyable enough.
