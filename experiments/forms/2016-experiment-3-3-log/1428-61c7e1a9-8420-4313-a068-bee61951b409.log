strategy,Initially, wandered aimlessly until I found the magic spot.  Then i&#039;d stop/slow down while within it.
changes,Would start to pay much more attention to what others were doing and how they would play.  It becomes increasingly more obvious when a a spot is found by someone as the game went on.
others,Eventually, yes.
relative,same
bugs,No problems on my end.
instructions,Pretty clear, moreso as you actually get to play the game.
fair,Felt very fair.
comments,none.
