strategy,In general, I tried to keep the avatar constantly accelerated in order to cover as much ground as possible so that I improved my odds of finding the magical bonus region. If I spotted other avatars lingering in a certain spot, I would try to get there in time to see if it was a magical bonus region, otherwise I continued to explore on my own.
changes,I initially tried to follow other avatars to see if they were better able to find the magical bonus regions than I was. I eventually decided that this was not particularly effective and just went on my own.
others,I know that at least one person tried to follow my avatar around, so it is likely that at least one other person used a similar strategy.
relative,same
bugs,No bugs
instructions,Nothing was unclear
fair,The pay seems fair.
comments,I saw the briefing form, but only momentarily because grabbing HITs is a bit of a &quot;competition&quot; on Mechanical Turk. Generally speaking, workers are better off &quot;grabbing&quot; whatever HIT becomes availabe first and &quot;throwing back&quot; whatever they find to be not worth the time or effort. Because of this, I suggest you include the briefing sheet once the HIT has been accepted in addition to having it in preview mode.
