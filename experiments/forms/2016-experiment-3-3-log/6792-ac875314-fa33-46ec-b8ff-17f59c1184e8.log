strategy,was really too short because of technical reasons to find anything that worked well enough. I was just starting to look for the spot with a wide pattern
changes,again, due to being pulled from the game there wasn&#039;t time
others,the other player was able to move around much faster, but I think possibly wouuld have missed the notification that they were in a magic spot
relative,worse
bugs,yes, there was lag and I got pulled because of latency
instructions,one or more of the comprehension questions weren&#039;t answered in the instructions. would I get points if two players were in the same space
fair,it sounded fair if delivered
comments,why is it not possible to have a game designed that mere mortals on wifi can play?
