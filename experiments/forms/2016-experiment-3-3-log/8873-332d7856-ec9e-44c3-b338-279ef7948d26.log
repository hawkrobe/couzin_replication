strategy,I was watching the other arrows and if they stopped or slowed down I went to their area right away while also randomly moving around the map to find the sparkle.
changes,No, I used the same strategy throughout the whole exercise.
others,Yes, because the other players would come to me when I stopped because my arrow was sparkling.
relative,same
bugs,It got choppy in the middle and towards the end but the rest of the time there was no problem.
instructions,No
fair,Yes
comments,None
