strategy,I was looking in areas other players weren&#039;t but if I saw one other player stop moving, I assumed they found it and I would go over to them. I would then try to follow the movement of the area as best I could until I completely lost track of it.
changes,I completely forgot you could stop moving until about 2 minutes in. Once I remembered that I started looking for stopped players. At that point I used the same strategy the rest of the game.
others,Yes, it seemed like other people were using the same strategy. We would all flock to whatever player stopped moving first.
relative,same
bugs,No bugs
instructions,It would have been nice if the instructions before the game told me how I was supposed to move. I figured it out quickly because it said at the bottom of the screen, but that&#039;s something that should be explained beforehand.
fair,Yes, the pay was very fair.
comments,Was fun!
