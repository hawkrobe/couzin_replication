strategy,I tried to use a grid to find the right area, then stay in that area
changes,it seemed like the area was moving quite quickly. I couldn&#039;t seem to stay in it
others,don&#039;t know, didn&#039;t see any other players
relative,
bugs,I was using &quot;a&quot; to move faster to find the right areas, and I wondered if there was some lag between when I was in the right spot and when the sparkes were shown
instructions,nope
fair,ok
