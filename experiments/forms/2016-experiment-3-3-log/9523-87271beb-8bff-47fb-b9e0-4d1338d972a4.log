strategy,Explore the map as quickly as possible, however, if your partner slows down, accelerate towards them, because they are probably within the sphere of influence.
changes,It did only in so far as how I moved directionally. It took me a minute to realize he was the accelerate option. And I realized that diagonal search options would be optimal after my partner disappeared, who I assume was an AI.
others,I would have to imagine that most people would come up with a similar strategy.
relative,same
bugs,According to the definition where the sphere of influence I forget exactly what you guys call that, it certainly did not move linearly it definitely teleported across the map at regular intervals. I expect that is intentional though, so for being a bug? I don&#039;t know.
instructions,No.
fair,The pay was more than fair, far more than fair. This is honestly one of the best HITs I have ever taken place.
comments,I am a game developer by trade, and there&#039;s actually some potential to this idea. I&#039;m sure this is nothing more than a study, by it&#039;s a pretty decent idea to have that sphere that provides that power out, but that&#039;s invisible to everybody else. I might have to steal it for my next game ;)
