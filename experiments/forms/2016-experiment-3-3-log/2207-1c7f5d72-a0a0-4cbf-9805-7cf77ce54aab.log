strategy,kept searching then when found tried to ascertain direction and match speed by going in small circles
changes,yes, started out not matching speed well enough and looking at what other players were doing so i lost the area a lot and watching the others didnt help me
others,possibly
relative,better
bugs,had one lag spike that put me against the wall with a warning to get off the wall
instructions,no
fair,yes
comments,none at this time.
