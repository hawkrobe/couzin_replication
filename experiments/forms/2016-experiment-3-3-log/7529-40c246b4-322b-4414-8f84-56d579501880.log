strategy,While I read the instructions, I didn&#039;t quite have a feel for the game until the first minute in. Once I became comfortable with the commands, I started using accelerate pretty much full time to find the active spot and stop.
changes,Yes, it evolved as I realized more and more what I could do. I initially moved around slowly to find the active spot and then just click around in it. Then accelerated a bit and would hit S for a second and click around. Then I eventually realized I could just hold S, so I decided to accelerate the whole time and just S once I found the active spot.
others,I think most people would eventually come to the same strategy (if they are used to playing games)
relative,better
bugs,no bugs noted
instructions,They were clear, but until I actually got in the game and had a chance to test the mechanics, I didn&#039;t quite get the idea.
fair,yes
comments,none, thanks. was fun.
