strategy,I scanned around to see if I could predict how slowly or how fast the sparkle area was.
changes,Yes, I followed the other player at first but then I realized I could just scan around faster than them t find it.
others,Yes I do.
relative,better
bugs,Nope
instructions,None
fair,I feel like it took around 8 minutes to do this entire hit so not including the bonus I would up the pay to .80 base.
comments,None, good hit!
