strategy,going as fast as I could criss crossing the screen to look for the magic area, then stopping.
changes,at first I was more random before instituting a system.
others,yes, but not the other person I could see. they rarely increased their speed and did more back &amp; forth in small areas.  but they still may have been more successful.
relative,same
bugs,no
instructions,no. took me  a minute to figure out how to change direction because apparently I&#039;m stupid.
fair,yes
comments,fun exercise.
