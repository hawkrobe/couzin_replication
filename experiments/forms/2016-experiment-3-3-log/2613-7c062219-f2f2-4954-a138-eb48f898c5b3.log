strategy,I tried to cover as much area of the playing field until I landed on the secret area. Once I did, I stopped and stayed there until the area moved.
changes,That was my strategy for most of the game. Over time I started paying more attention to what other people were doing. If I saw someone stop, I accelerated over to their area because they had most likely found a bonus where they were sitting.
others,Yes.
relative,better
bugs,No.
instructions,No.
fair,Yes.
comments,No.
