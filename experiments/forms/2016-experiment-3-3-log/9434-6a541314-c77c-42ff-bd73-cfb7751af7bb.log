strategy,I tried to sweep the whole box at high speed as if it were a grid rows or columns at a time.  If i saw some one else stop i would move to their position and and see if they found the bonus area.
changes,Same general strategy.
others,Likely but possibly not
relative,better
bugs,no bugs
instructions,No.
fair,Yes
comments,Would be nice to see other players scores. For me it drives competition and enhances my motivation.
