strategy,I tried to imagine where the bonus area would be and tried to follow it.
changes,Yes, at first I was watching the other players. If I saw a player that was stopped, I thought that he/she had found the bonus area. This changed rather quickly as it didn&#039;t work well.
others,I think that most people followed each other. I noticed most players were in the same general area
relative,better
bugs,No, I didn&#039;t experience any problems.
instructions,No, everything was rather clear in the instructions.
fair,With the bonus amount, yes, the pay was fair.
comments,Thank you! This was a unique and fun study.
