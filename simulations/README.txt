Configurations are set by exp_config.py and config.py

for simulations related to experiment 1, run `python experiment1.py`, and likewise for experiment 2 and 3.

to visualize a simulation run as a video, run, e.g., `sh make_video.sh output/predictions-emergent/spot-2-asocial-1-`

note that you must have [`ffmpeg`](http://ffmpeg.org) installed (on mac, you can get it via homebrew with `brew install ffmpeg`)
