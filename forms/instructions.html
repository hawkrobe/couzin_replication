        <div class="progress-bar" role="progressbar" aria-valuenow="5" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100" style="width: 5%;"><span class="sr-only">5% Complete</span></div>

        <h1>Instructions</h1>
      </div>

      <p>At the end of these instructions, you will be required to
      answer a brief quiz to assess your understanding.  This quiz
      should be straight-forward if you read the instructions.  If you
      fail this quiz, however, you will not be able to play the game,
      so <strong>read these instructions carefully</strong>.</p>

      <p>After finishing the instructions, you will then enter a
      waiting room for a game.  Some games require multiple
      participants, so you may have to wait for other players to join
      before the game will start.  The maximum time you will spend in
      the waiting room is five minutes.  While you are waiting for
      other players, feel free to familiarize yourself with the
      controls in the game.  The game controls are the same in the
      waiting room as in the real game.</p>

      
      <p>Once the game starts, you will see a screen that looks much
      like the following:</p>

      <p>
      <center><img src="gameplay-1.png" alt="Example gameplay" style="width:304px;height:228px"></center>
	  </p>

      <p>
	You will be in control of the blue triangle.  You will start
	out moving at a constant speed.  <strong>Holding down space
	bar will increase your speed.  The left and right arrow keys
	will control the direction of your movement.</strong> You will
	have a score at each point in the game, indicated by the
	percentage shown at the top of the page.  Each location in the
	game area is associated with a certain score.  <strong>Your
	goals is to locate yourself in high scoring locations for as
	long as possible.</strong> <strong>You will receive a cash
	bonus based on your cumulative score in the game.</strong> The
	scores of locations will change over time, so you will have to
	continuously be ready to move around to maximize your bonus.
	Note that in the waiting room, the score for every location
	will be zero, but this will change once the game starts.
      </p>
      
	<p>
	  You will also be able to see the other participants who are
	  currently playing in your game.  These players can also see
	  you.  <strong>The other players get the same scores as you
	  do at the same locations, and there is no competition
	  between players.</strong>  For example, as shown in the
	  following screenshot, there is no penalty for being close to
	  another player:
	</p>

      <p>
      <center><img src="gameplay-2.png" alt="Example gameplay" style="width:304px;height:228px"></center>
	  </p>

      <p><strong>After the game ends, you will receive a survey code
      to submit with your HIT.  You must submit the code exactly as
      shown to receive your bonuses.</strong></p>

      <strong>You will only have one chance to pass this quiz.  If you want to
