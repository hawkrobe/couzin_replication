        <h1>Instructions</h1>
      </div>

      <p>At the end of these instructions, you will be required to
      answer a brief quiz to assess your understanding,
      so <strong>read these instructions carefully</strong>.</p>

      <p>After finishing the instructions, you will enter a waiting
      room for a game.  Some games require multiple participants, so
      you may have to wait for other players to join before the game
      will start.  <strong>The maximum time you will spend in the
      waiting room is five minutes.</strong></p>

      
      <p>Once the game starts, you will see a screen that looks much
      like the following:</p>

      <p>
      <center><img src="gameplay-1.png" alt="Example gameplay" style="width:304px;height:228px"></center>
	  </p>

      <p>
	You will be in control of the blue triangle.  When you are not
	holding down any keys, you will move at a slow speed.
	<strong>Holding down space bar will increase your speed.  The
	left and right arrow keys will control the direction of your
	movement.</strong>
      </p>
      </p>
	You will have a score at each point in the game, indicated by
	the percentage shown at the top of the page.  Each location in
	the game area is associated with a certain score.
	<strong>Your goal is to locate yourself in high scoring
	locations for as long as possible.</strong> <strong>You will
	receive a cash bonus based on your cumulative score in the
	game.</strong> The scores of locations will change over time,
	so you will have to continuously be ready to move around to
	maximize your bonus.  Note that in the waiting room, the score
	for every location will be zero, but this will change once the
	game starts.
      </p>
      
	<p>
	  You will also be able to see the other participants who are
	  currently playing in your game.  These players can also see
	  you.  <strong>The score at any particular location at any
	  particular point in time is the same for all players, and
	  there is no competition between players.</strong>
	</p>

	<p>
	  You may experience lag during gameplay.  If your character
	  stops moving just wait for the network to catch up.
	  </p>

      <p><strong>After the game ends, you will receive a survey code
      to submit with your HIT.  You must submit the code exactly as
      shown to receive your bonuses.</strong></p>
