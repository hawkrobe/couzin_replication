2016-10-10-21-35-28-350
The strategy used to play the game was one of trial and error. Additionally, I tried to slow down upon finally discerning the magic area. 
Well, I don&#039;t think it really changed. However, at first I started out slowly, then I became swifter, then finally, I slowed down upon finding the magic area. 
yes
Poorly
There was some choppiness. 
No, the instructions were crystal clear.
The pay was fair. 
Interesting, engaging, fun, well-designed, and enjoyable study.
2016-10-10-17-19-51-870
I tried to go around the entire square to cover as much ground as possible and also look at the other &quot;players&quot; arrow to see when they would slow down considerably.
No, it did not. 
I don&#039;t believe so.
I think I scored well enough or just as much as others.
I did not notice any problems.
Nothing seemed unclear.
Yes, I do.
Thank you so much and good luck with your research. 
2016-10-10-18-18-41-813
I accelerated over the board until I found the magic area and then I coasted or hit S to stop, even though I kept moving.
No, I kept the same strategy of acceleration over the play area.
No, they were moving slower than I was.
I think I did better.
No, no problems at all.
No, everything was clear.
Yes.
I thought it was fun, thank you. I would play again.

I tried to find where the bonus area was and stay there as long as possible
no my strategy didnt change
probably
about the same, maybe worse
no
no
No, It was pretty low considering I had read all the instrctions, answer questions,  waited a few minutes, then got kicked out due to &quot;inactivity&quot; even though I was just waiting for the game to start as instructed, so i had to re do the instructions, answer the questions again, wait again, and then do the game, which did not yield a very high bonus
