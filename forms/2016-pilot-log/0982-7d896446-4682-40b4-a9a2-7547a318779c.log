strategy,I tried to find the magical area myself at first and watched where other went. If they stopped or grouped together, I would go there because most people were stopping when they found the magical area to get more time it. 
changes,It changed twice. My first strategy quickly changed once I noticed others were stopping when they found the area.
others,Yes after some time I believe we all paid attention to where others were and how they were moving.
relative,same
bugs,No.
instructions,No.
fair,Yes.
comments,It was a fun game. Thanks!
