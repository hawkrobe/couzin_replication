strategy,When I got one of the magic zones, I stopped.
changes,Yes, that was my final strategy.  At first, I moved slowly within it.  I think I changed on the 3d one.
others,Maybe.  It seems going slowly worked just as well.
relative,worse
bugs,no
instructions,no
fair,yes
comments,It was a little dull - the zones didn&#039;t come up very often.  When the first one case, I was rather taken by surprise, so I&#039;m sure people who play video games more than I did better!
