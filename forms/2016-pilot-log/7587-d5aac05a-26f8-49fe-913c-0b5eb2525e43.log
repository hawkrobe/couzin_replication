strategy,I just moved from spot to spot until I&#039;d start to sparkle and then I would stop until I stopped sparkling. If I saw another player stop, I&#039;d try to get over there as fast as I could.
changes,No.
others,I think the other players probably did use that same strategy.
relative,same
bugs,I had no problems.
instructions,The instructions were perfectly clear to me.
fair,I do feel the pay was fair.
comments,If it were me, I might&#039;ve made it so that you moved faster by default and used a button to slow down instead of accelerate, and kept the button that let you come to a complete stop.
