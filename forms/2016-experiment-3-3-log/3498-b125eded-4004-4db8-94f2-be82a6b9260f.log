strategy,I tried to follow the &quot;invisible&quot; bonus area around the play area. I tried to move along with it.
changes,At first, I would stop completely when I started sparkling. Then, I realized it was better to move with the area instead and try to stay inside it at all times.
others,I think the other player was simply following me around since I was able to find the bonus area more easily.
relative,better
bugs,I did not notice any problems or bugs in the game.
instructions,The game instructions were very clear.
fair,I think that the pay is fair considering you are also giving a bonus.
