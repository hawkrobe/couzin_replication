strategy,I tried to find the scoring area (where my avatar sparkled) and then stay with it as it moved. If I lost it I tried to make a perimeter and track it down. I spent a good period of time trying to find it after I lost it though, it was challenging.
changes,I started doing more circles around where I knew the scoring areas were eventually, compared to using zig-zagging motions at the beginning.
others,Maybe, I would guess some would try it, yes.
relative,same
bugs,Nope.
instructions,Nope.
fair,Yes
comments,This was an interesting HIT, thanks!
