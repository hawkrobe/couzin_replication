strategy,If I found the spot, I would click around a lot to try to get a sense of which way the bonus area was moving - if I wasn&#039;t in the bonus, I would make large, sweeping paths through the field to try to find it again.
changes,Not really, no
others,probably - the spot moved almost constantly, so you had to readjust constantly as well
relative,same
bugs,no
instructions,no
fair,sure, it was fine
comments,none  - thank you
