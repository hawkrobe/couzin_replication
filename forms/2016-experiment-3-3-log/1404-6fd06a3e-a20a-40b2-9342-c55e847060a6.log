comments,I&#039;ve switched to the other tab for literally a second, to complete the HIT I was previously working on; Went back and the game became unresponsive... sigh... I&#039;ve pressed the &quot;Disconnect&quot; button, thinking that it will let me get back in... what a shame. I really wanted to try this out.
