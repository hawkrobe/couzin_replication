strategy,I tried watching the other players when they stopped for very long, figuring the magic spot was there. That strategy didn&#039;t seem to work, not sure if the other 2 players were human.
changes,I mostly tried to cover as much of the screen as possible using A until I found the spot. I got to the strategy fairly quickly
others,Maybe, it was hard to tell.
relative,same
bugs,No problems.
instructions,No, they were straightforward. But it didn&#039;t seem like the magic spots traveled like in the video.
fair,Yes
