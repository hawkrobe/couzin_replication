strategy,I would slow down everytime I was in the magic spot, and try to predict what direction it was going. I would also see if one of the other players had suddenly slowed down. 
changes,It took me a little bit to reach my strategy. First I just went everywhere in hopes to catch the spot. After awhile I slowed down and tried to keep up with where it was going.
others,I think so.
relative,
bugs,No.
instructions,No.
fair,Yes.
comments,Survey and game went smoothly.
