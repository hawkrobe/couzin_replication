strategy,I sped around as fast I could until I found the bonus spot, then immediately stopped. Occasionally I looked at the other play to see if they were hovering around an area. If they were I moved to them.
changes,I came up with the strategy pretty much right away, and I didn&#039;t change.
others,The other player did not seem to use the accelerate or stop features as much as I did, but they did move around often and move towards me when I paused.
relative,same
bugs,One player disappeared a few seconds into the game. I don&#039;t know if that was their problem or mine.
instructions,Everything was clear.
fair,yes
comments,I only played with one other person. I think I could&#039;ve done better with more people around.
