strategy,I would watch to see where the other players would slow down and cluster.
changes,Over time, I realized that the bonus area was slowly moving, so I attempted to slowly keep moving and stay inside.
others,I think other people were also watching other players.  I faked out players from time to time and they came rushing over.
relative,same
bugs,No. 
instructions,Everything was clear.
fair,Pay was very fair.
comments,Thank you!
