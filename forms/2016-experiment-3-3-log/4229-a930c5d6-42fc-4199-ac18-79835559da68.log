strategy,I tried to pay attention to other players while I moved around the screen. If I noticed that one of them stopped, I would go over to their area and see if it sparkled.
changes,My strategy didn&#039;t change over time. I used one I developed at the beginning.
others,I think it&#039;s likely they used the same strategy.
relative,same
bugs,I sometimes had problems clicking when I got stuck against a wall.
instructions,No.
fair,Yes.
