strategy,There was no real strategy for the overall game until I realize some players gathered in one area. Anytime I saw players stop and gather, I&#039;d try to join them to catch quick points as soon as possible.
changes,Yes, only about 3-4 times if I was close enough to the other players
others,Yes, I do believe so.
relative,worse
bugs,No. The game was consistent and I didn&#039;t have any kind of glitch or other errors.
instructions,Everything was straight forward
fair,Yes, I think so.
comments,None. I just wish I played better. Thank you
