strategy,I avoided corners and went towards more general areas. At first I followed arrows that accelerated towards an area but realized that I slowed down when I sparkled so I followed the slower ones. 
changes,I changed twice. The first change was almost immediate, about 30 seconds in, and the second change was later around 3 minutes in. 
others,Yes, it&#039;s likely.
relative,same
bugs,No
instructions,No
fair,Yes
