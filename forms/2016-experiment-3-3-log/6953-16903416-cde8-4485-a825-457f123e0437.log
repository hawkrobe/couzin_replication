strategy,When I got into the sparkly circle I tried to slow down and determine the path.
changes,I was unsure when I left the sparkly circle if it stayed on the same path or reset.  I would try to find the circle nearby and then venture across the box.
others,I suppose.
relative,same
bugs,I did not notice any problems.
instructions,The directions were pretty clear.
fair,Yes.
