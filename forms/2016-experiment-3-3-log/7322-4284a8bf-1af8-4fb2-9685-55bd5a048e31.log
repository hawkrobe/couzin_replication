strategy,I would try and find which way the area was moving and let the ship move at its normal speed towards that direction. If I could not find the area I would look at other players and see if they were stopped or slowly moving and that would show the area that had the points.
changes,Strategy changed on finding the area just in how I scoped the play area. Sometimes I went side to side or up and down depending on where I lost the points area.
others,I think so. I think it was one of the more efficient strategies.
relative,better
bugs,No bugs were noticed.
instructions,Everything was clear.
fair,I think the base should be higher by 50 cents. Overall I think this is fine for the amount of time though.
comments,Interesting hit and I enjoyed it. Thanks.
