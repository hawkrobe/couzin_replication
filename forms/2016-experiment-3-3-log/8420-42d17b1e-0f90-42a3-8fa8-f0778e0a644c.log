strategy,I tried to watch the other players to see if they were all gathering in one pot, and if so, I followed.  Otherwise, I just quickly went from spot to spot to hopefully find the magical spot.
changes,My strategy stayed the same, I just quickly went from spot to spot, but if I saw others all going to one spot, I tried to quickly go there too.  It stayed this way through the whole game.
others,Yes, I think other people paid attention to where all the other players were congregating.
