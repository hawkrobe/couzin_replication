strategy,I went in the shape of a square going from top to bottom and left to right, trying to find the magical spots. When I came across a magical spot I would try to stop and then try to follow it.
changes,At first I just went from top to bottom and left to right and would just pass through the magical spots. Then I realized that you could sort off follow the magical spots, in order to get more points.
others,Yes.
relative,same
bugs,No.
instructions,No.
fair,Yes.
