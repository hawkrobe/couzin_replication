strategy,I tried to quickly accelerate around the region until I saw sparkles and then would slow and stop. I would also watch to see where the others congregated and if anyone else had stopped.
changes,I started out by not paying attention to the other players, but at the last 1/3 of the game I did begin to key off others&#039; behaviors.
others,I think players were watching each other since there was some congregating and that seemed to happen when a few players gathered in the same area and slowed.
relative,worse
bugs,no, it was great
instructions,It was unclear whether the speed of movement of the magic area was truly as slow as shown on the demo
fair,Yes
comments,Thank you - this was fun
