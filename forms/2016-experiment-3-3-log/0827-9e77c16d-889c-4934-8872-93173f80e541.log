strategy,randomly going around until I sparkle, then stopping to maximize time in the sparkle. 
changes,Sometimes I would try and follow other players, if I hadn&#039;t found the sparkle in a while.  Maybe every 25 seconds or so, probably 10 times.
others,Yes, I do.
relative,same
bugs,No, it seemed a little sensitive to the touchpad, maybe a mouse would work better, but otherwise no problems.
instructions,No.
fair,Yes, fair enough.
comments,No, but thank you!
