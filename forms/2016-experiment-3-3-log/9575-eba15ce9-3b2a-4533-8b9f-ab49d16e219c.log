strategy,Move as fast as possible when not in the sparkle, watch other players for quick stops, work a pattern around the area of the sparkle once it fades
changes,yes, i initially scanned much slower and sped up after while
others,yes
relative,better
bugs,slight choppy movement on ocassion
instructions,Stop should have stated to hold &quot;S&quot; rather than press
fair,yes
comments,fun hit!
