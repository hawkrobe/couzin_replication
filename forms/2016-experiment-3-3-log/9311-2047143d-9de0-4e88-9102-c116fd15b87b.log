strategy,I tried to follow the pattern, and once my arrow sparkled, I stopped. 
changes,Not really. I kept at it and kept trying to increase my time in the bonus area.
others,Maybe.
relative,same
bugs,No, I didn&#039;t notice any bugs.
instructions,No.
fair,Yes. I would&#039;ve liked a higher bonus, but given that was based on my own efforts, I can&#039;t say anything negative. Just disappointed in my own performance, ha!
comments,Thank you for the chance to participate! I really enjoyed this study and the game itself was fun. :)
