strategy,There was absolutely no way to do it.  you had to randomly move and hope that the controls would react fast enough to stop when you landed in the field.  Usually it didn&#039;t; the controls were terribly unreactive
changes,no.
others,They didn&#039;t have a choice.  
relative,same
bugs,Choppy movements, the buttons having to be pushed at least twice in order to work.  If they worked at all.  
instructions,yes.  at no point was it obvious that the mouse click determined the direction of travel.  you had to figure it out on your own.  There was an image of a mouse pointer/arrow at the bottom, but without explanation, you couldn&#039;t use that as instruction.
fair,This question is not relevant to the survey, and cannot be answered.
comments,no more than I&#039;ve already given.
