strategy,I would try to maximize the amount of points I could earn by staying in the field while being unnoticed and accelerated the whole time except on the magical regions.
changes,When I felt I had a secure lead over the others, I would sometimes stop at a place even if there wasn&#039;t a magical region to make the others come to me and waste their time. That happened around 4 times.
others,Yes, it felt like some other people tried to trick the opposition by standing still on a spot that wasn&#039;t actual magical.
relative,better
bugs,No, everything was fine
instructions,No
fair,Yes
comments,Fun game, I like doing surveys like these.
