strategy,I tried to zip around using &#039;a&#039; to locate the bonus area, then drift when I was in the bonus area, then search around when I saw that I was no longer in the bonus area
changes,At one time it looked like the other players were all grouped up, and I assumed that they were all in the bonus area, but when I went over to check it out, they were not, so I ignored what the other players were doing after that
others,I don&#039;t think, it didn&#039;t look like the others were using the &#039;a&#039; key as much as I was
relative,same
bugs,No
instructions,No
