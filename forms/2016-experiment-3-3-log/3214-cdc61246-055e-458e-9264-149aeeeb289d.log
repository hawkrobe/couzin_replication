strategy,I ran around randomly and watched for the other player to stop moving.
changes,It took a min to figure out that I would do it this way.

relative,better
bugs,Not that I noticed
instructions,Everything seemed clear enough
fair,It is decent pay I guess better then most but not the most generous pay I&#039;ve seen to be perfectly honest.
