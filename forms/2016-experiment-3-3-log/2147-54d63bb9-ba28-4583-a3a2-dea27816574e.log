strategy,move around and cover the most area fast, then when I hit the magic spot stop
changes,I kind of zig zagged through the area, I don&#039;t know but I figure that way I could cover the most area.
others,I think somewhat yes
relative,better
bugs,no, once or twice there might have been choppy movement but not much and it wasn&#039;t long maybe half a second hiccup.
instructions,no
fair,yes
comments,none
