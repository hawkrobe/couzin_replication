strategy,I was searching throughout the board for a zone as fast as I could while also paying close attention to the other players when they stopped moving or slowed down. When they slowed or stopped I assumed that they were either in the zone or near it and went to their location to see if I also could get into the zone.
changes,I tried this strategy throughout the entire game with a slight alteration for when I searching I made sure to stay away from other players so that we all could maximize the search area.
others,I think as the game went on others seemed to adopt the same strategy.
relative,better
bugs,I didn&#039;t have any problems in the game.
instructions,Everything was clear to me.
fair,I think the pay is very fair.
