strategy,I tried to search for the bonus by zig zagging across the play area to maximize my chance of brushing against it. Once I make contact, I adjust my course to stay within the bonus. As the game progressed, I started to keep an eye on the other players as they suddenly slow down, often indicating that they have found the bonus.
changes,About a minute into play, I notice two other players that consistently find the bonus. I started to keep track of them whenever they slow down because that often revealed the location of the bonus. It was hard to distinguish the other players I have selected as guides.
others,I believe other players used a similar strategy; however, I believe one player&#039;s search pattern was more linear and another was circular. This contrasted with my zig zag method. I may have misread their search patterns since my browser would freeze for a second every once in a while.
relative,worse
bugs,Definitely choppy. My internet connection at my home is about 4Mbps down, 1Mbps up, and 38 ms ping. I do not believe anyone else was using wifi since they&#039;re all engrossed with a new TV show.
instructions,N/A
fair,Yes, plus it was entertaining. People usually pay for entertainment, so getting paid to play is definitely nice.
comments,If the game was truly multiplayer, then other people&#039;s connection speed and quality may be why my experience was choppy. Not game breaking, but I felt I would have been more effective if the game play was smoother.
