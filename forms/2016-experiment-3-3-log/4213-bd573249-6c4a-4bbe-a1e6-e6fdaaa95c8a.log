strategy,I just tried to find my sparkle and put on the brakes. I also watched the other players&#039; behavior for clues about where my sparkle might be.
changes,Yes, instead of looking randomly, I tried to use cues from the other players. If they weren&#039;t helping, I looked on my own. It took me about halfway to reach this final strategy.
others,Possibly. Everyone seemed to be grouping up by the end, or we were just getting better.
relative,same
bugs,Nope
instructions,Nope
fair,Yes
comments,Thanks! That was a ton of fun.
