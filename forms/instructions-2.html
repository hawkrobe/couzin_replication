<p>The game you will play is a kind of digital easter egg hunt / hide and seek.</p>

<p>You will navigate your avatar through a rectangular playing area, possibly together with other players.</p>

<p>At each point in time during the game, some regions of this area will be “magical bonus regions”.</p>

<p>When you are in a magical bonus region, your avatar will sparkle.</p>

<p>The locations of the magical bonus region moves continuously over time from one point to another (you will not be able to view the moving area during gameplay). 

<b><p>Your goal is to maximize the amount of time you spend in magical bonus regions regions, i.e., to locate the regions where your avatar sparkles.  Your displayed score will only increase in magical bonus regions.</p></b>

<p>You will only see sparkles on your own avatar, never on other avatars, even if they are in a magical bonus region, but the magical bonus regions are in the same places for everyone.</p>

<b><p>There is no competition between players; the magical region is not consumed by players. It simply changes location over time.</p></b>

      <p><strong>IMPORTANT: If you are detected as inactive in the the
       game, you will be removed from the game and your HIT may not be
       approved.  In order to remain active, you must stay present in
       the browser tab and off the walls in the game.</strong></p>

      <p><strong>After the game ends, there will be a short survey,
      you will then receive a survey code to submit with your HIT.
      You must submit the code exactly as shown to receive your
      bonus.</strong></p>
