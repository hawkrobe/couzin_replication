<p>The game you will play is a kind of digital easter egg hunt / hide and seek.</p>

<p>You will navigate your avatar through a rectangular playing area, possibly together with other players, as in this image:</p>

      <p>
      <img src="no-sparkles.png" alt="Example gameplay" style="width:304px">
	  </p>

<p>At each point in time during the game, some regions of this area will be “magical bonus regions”.</p>

<p>When you are in a magical bonus region, your avatar will sparkle, as in this image:</p>

      <p>
      <img src="sparkles.png" alt="Example gameplay" style="width:304px">
	  </p>

<p>The locations of the magical bonus regions in the game change over time.</p>

<p>Your goal is to maximize the amount of time you spend in magical bonus regions regions, i.e., to locate the regions where your avatar sparkles.  Your score increases at a constant baseline rate during the game, but will increase much more quickly in magical bonus regions.</p>

<p>You will only see sparkles on your own avatar, never on other avatars, even if they are in a magical bonus region, but the magical bonus regions are in the same places for everyone.</p>

<p>There is no competition between players; the magical region is not consumed by players. It simply changes location over time.</p>

<p>You will begin the game in a waiting room, where you may wait for other players. There are no magical regions in the waiting room.</p>

<p><strong>Please remain active in the game at all times during the experiment, or you will be removed from the game.</strong></p>
