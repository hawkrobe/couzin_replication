strategy,I mostly scanned around till I found a ping and hit my stop button, I tried tracking where the bubble was going, but utterly failed virtually every time.
changes,no, my general strategy stayed the same from when I read the initial rules, though I didn&#039;t emphasize using the stop button till late in the experiment.
others,perhaps.
relative,same
bugs,no
instructions,no
fair,maybe, I&#039;m leaning towards no.
comments,thank you for the game it was amusing.
