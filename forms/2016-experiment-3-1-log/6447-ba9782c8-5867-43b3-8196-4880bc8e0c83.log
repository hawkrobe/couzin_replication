strategy,At first, I went around the border of the area, going a little further in after each time around, but didn&#039;t find the magical area that way, so after that I just randomly went around looking for it. At the same time, I watched the other player to see if he had stopped anywhere. 
changes,I only changed my strategy once, once I started finding the magical area. It only took me two trips around the border, inching in, to realize that was a bad idea. 
others,I think he was just moving around randomly. He didn&#039;t seem to stop anywhere.
