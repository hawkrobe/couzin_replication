strategy,I pressed down A to move as fast as possible when not glowing... when glowing I slowed down to try and follow the flow
changes,it took me awhile to realize the advantage of slowing down when glowing; figured that out about 30 seconds into the game
others,probably not; I think there was a better strategy that I did not figure out
relative,worse
bugs,no
instructions,no
fair,yes
comments,kinda fun... wish it had lasted longer
