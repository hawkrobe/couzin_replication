strategy,The latest and most effective one was to monitor other players&#039; behavior: if they suddenly stop or start moving extremely slowly, then it&#039;s obvious that they are in the bonus zone. In such case I&#039;d rush to that point.
changes,3 strategies, reached the final one maybe by the middle of the game
others,By that time or a bit later - yes.
relative,worse
bugs,No
instructions,I didn&#039;t notice that there are A (accelerate) and S (stop) options until well into the game (because I was focused on moving, staying far from the walls - to avoid being disqualified), and even after learning about S didn&#039;t realize for a while that you have to press it continuously, otherwise you slow down only a bit. Would be great if A and S options were mentioned/explained in pre-game instructions.
fair,yes
comments,it was fun
