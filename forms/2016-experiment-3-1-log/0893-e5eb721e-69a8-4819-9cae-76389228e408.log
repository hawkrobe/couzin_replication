strategy,I accelerated around the map until my arrow sparkled. One I found the bonus area I moved back and forth slowly until it vanished, then I repeated the process.
changes,No, my strategy did not change as it seemed to work well from the start.
others,No. The other played followed each other in a group, likely assuming that one player had found the bonus area.
relative,better
bugs,I had no problems with the game.
instructions,Everything was made clear about the gameplay.
fair,Yes.
comments,I have no other feedback.
