strategy,ran around accelerating at all times save for when I hit a zone, then stopped until I stopped gaining points. Repeated this pattern.
changes,Not really--I did start out moving in &quot;Union Jack&quot; patterns and this lessened later, where I would start trying to circle the last known location of the zone.
others,no
relative,better
bugs,no
instructions,no
fair,yes
comments,Thanks! Decent pay for an OK game.
