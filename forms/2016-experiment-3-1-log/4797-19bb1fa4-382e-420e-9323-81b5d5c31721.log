strategy,Tried to find the spot on my own and pay attention to other players focusing on a spot, move slightly when in a spot to try to find direction &quot;it&quot; was headed.
changes,Not really. Kind of had that in my mind from the jump.
others,Yes, seems like the most logical way to do it.
relative,better
bugs,no, but when I started I was right near a wall and hit it in the waiting room, so hope that doesn&#039;t affect me
instructions,no
fair,Yes
comments,Hit a wall in the waiting room right when I got there fyi...
