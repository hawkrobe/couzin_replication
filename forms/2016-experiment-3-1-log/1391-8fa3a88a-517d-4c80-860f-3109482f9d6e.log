strategy,I was trying to find the circle myself mostly but then I did change and went off the other two players in the game
changes,Yes it changed once I went from just me trying to zig zag my way up and down to mainly following the other players when I saw them slow down or stop.
others,Yes I think they did the zig zag and saw if others slowed or stopped that we may be at the circle
relative,same
bugs,no problems
instructions,everything was clear
fair,for the time yes the pay was fair
comments,This was a pretty fun game.
