strategy,move fast and try to see a sparkle. no other players to give me info.
changes,not really.
others,saddly, I don&#039;t think there were other people
relative,same
bugs,i&#039;m not a game player, so it took me a while to get the hang of it. 
instructions, I forgot I was in the waiting room at first so was wondering why I couldn&#039;t find any sparkles
fair,ok.  I wasn&#039;t very good but it seemed I was terrible at guessing where the sparkles moved ... OR ... the game wasn&#039;t fair.
comments,interesting.
