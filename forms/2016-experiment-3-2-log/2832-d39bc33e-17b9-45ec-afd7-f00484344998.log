strategy,I basically accelerated my avatar all over as fast as I could so I could quickly find the special spots. Additionally, I kept an eye on the other players and watched them if they stopped somewhere, since that would indicate that they found a special spot. If I saw them suddenly stop, I would rush toward their spot
changes,No, I used the same strategy the whole time.
others,Yes, I think they did. It sure seemed like it to me. They rushed towards me when I stopped at a spot and only one of them was accelerating all over the place like I was. The other person seemed to be moving at a leisurely pace the whole time.
relative,same
bugs,No problems.
instructions,Instructions were clear.
fair,The pay is extremely fair.
comments,This is a very fun HIT.
