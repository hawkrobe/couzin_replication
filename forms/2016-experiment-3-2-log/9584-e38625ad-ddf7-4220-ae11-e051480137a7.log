strategy,I would just accelerate until I would find a sparkly area and then just slow down when I get into it. Occasionally I would check at the other players areas to see if it is there or not.
changes,It did not really change over time.
others,I think the other people would do their own thing and used different strategies.
relative,better
bugs,I didn&#039;t notice any bugs really
instructions,Everything was clear.
fair,I think the bonus could have been a little bit better. 0.0002 seems a little low per point considering how many points I have gotten.
comments,It was an interesting game.
