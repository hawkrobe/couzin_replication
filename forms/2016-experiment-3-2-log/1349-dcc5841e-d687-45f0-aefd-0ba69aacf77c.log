strategy,I held accelerate the whole time just cruising around and when I spotted the target just kept clicking wildly around it trying to stay near. I always watched the other two players for similar behavior. 
changes,Not really, no. I used the strategy the whole time.
others,It looked liked the other two were just stopping on the target and then trying to find it again as it moved away. I tried to stay moving constantly so I could better gadge the movement of the target.
relative,better
bugs,None
instructions,The instructions were very clear.
fair,Very fair.
comments,More practice time would have been nice.
