strategy,My strategy was to move as fast as possible when I wasn&#039;t in a bonus area and then stop and stay there as long as I could when I found one. 
changes,Once. After maybe three minutes I started to wonder if the bonus areas moved around in a pattern and tried to predict the pattern. I&#039;m not sure if that was effective. 
others,Yes, probably.
relative,same
bugs,There was choppy movement a few times, but it wasn&#039;t very persistent. 
instructions,No.
fair,Yes.
comments,No.
