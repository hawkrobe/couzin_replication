strategy,I tried to go over the whole map until I found the bonus. Once I found it I would stop or go slow until it moved, then try to move around and find it again. I would also watch the other player. Usually, if they stopped, it meant they were on the bonus, so I would go to where they were.
changes,It changed a little. At first, when I lost the bonus, I tried to just go over the map again. Later, I tried starting to move around in something like a circle, widening outward, under the assumption that the bonus would be nearby. I also made more of an effort as the game progressed to stay away from the other player when they were moving quickly, so we wouldn&#039;t be covering the same ground in searching.
others,I think the other player used more or less the same strategy.
relative,worse
bugs,No
instructions,I wish you had been clearer about staying off the walls to avoid a disconnect. I found myself feeling very nervous about going anywhere near the walls. I&#039;m guessing it would have been reasonably forgiving (e.g. maybe requiring me to be against a wall for several seconds before disconnecting?) but greater clarity would have been very much appreciated.
fair,Yes, the pay seems good to me.
comments,No comments except what I&#039;ve already said about the game instructions.
